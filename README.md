Health Guardian: Disease Detection Using NLP
Health Guardian is an innovative project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect diseases based on symptoms input by users. The application analyzes symptom descriptions, identifies possible diseases, and suggests corresponding medicines and precautions. This system aims to assist users in recognizing health issues early and taking preventive measures.

🌟 Key Features
Disease Detection: Based on user-provided symptoms, the system identifies possible diseases.
Symptom Analysis: Analyzes symptoms using NLP to understand and match them to specific diseases.
Medicine Suggestions: Recommends appropriate medicines based on the detected disease.
Precautions and Tips: Provides useful precautions and health tips to prevent or manage the disease.
CSV Data Files:
precautions_df.csv: Contains data about diseases and corresponding precautions.
symptoms_df.csv: Stores a list of symptoms associated with various diseases.
workout_df.csv: Includes workout routines or exercises recommended based on the disease detected.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: For implementing the NLP algorithms and backend logic.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (reading and processing CSV files).
Natural Language Processing (NLP): For analyzing and detecting diseases from symptom descriptions.
Flask/Django: For building the web-based user interface (optional, if integrated).
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models (optional, if using any models).

📄 Data Description
precautions_df.csv: Contains data on diseases and their respective precautions to follow. It provides users with useful tips on preventing or managing health issues.

symptoms_df.csv: This file lists various symptoms, mapped to their respective diseases. It acts as a reference to detect possible diseases based on user-input symptoms.

workout_df.csv: Includes workout or exercise routines that are suggested for people suffering from specific diseases, to help them manage symptoms or improve their health condition.

⚙️ How to Use
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ayushiraut01/HEALTH-GUARDIAN-DISEASE-DETECTION-USING-NATURAL-LANGUAGE-PROCESSING
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script: To start the disease detection, run

python disease_detection.py
Input Symptoms:

Enter symptoms in the provided input interface (or use a terminal/CLI for basic interaction).
The system will return possible diseases along with the suggested medicines and precautions.

📈 How It Works
Step 1: The user inputs their symptoms in natural language (e.g., "fever, cough, fatigue").
Step 2: The NLP model processes the text to detect the most relevant diseases.
Step 3: Based on the detected disease, the system fetches corresponding medicines from the symptoms_df.csv and provides precautionary advice from the precautions_df.csv.
Step 4: Optional: Workout routines are also suggested using workout_df.csv based on the disease detected.

📊 Sample Data Files
1. precautions_df.csv
Disease	Precaution
Flu	Stay hydrated, rest, avoid contact with others
Diabetes	Regular exercise, balanced diet, check blood sugar
Hypertension	Reduce salt intake, monitor blood pressure
2. symptoms_df.csv
Symptom	Disease
Fever	Flu, Malaria
Cough	Flu, Pneumonia
Fatigue	Flu, Anemia
Chest Pain	Heart Disease
3. workout_df.csv
Disease	Recommended Exercise
Flu	Light walking, stretching
Diabetes	Moderate walking, cycling, strength training
Hypertension	Walking, swimming, yoga

🔮 Future Enhancements
Advanced NLP Models: Incorporating more advanced models like BERT or GPT to better understand and match symptoms.
Integration with Health APIs: Adding real-time health data from external sources (e.g., symptom checkers, health platforms).
User Authentication: Allowing users to save their medical history and track symptoms over time.
